## About

42 school introduction to C++. Modules 0 to 9. 

Principles of OOP:
- Encapsulation. All important information is contained inside a class and only select information is exposed. 
- Abstraction. Objects only reveal internal mechanisms that are relevant for the use of other objects, hiding any unnecessary implementation code. - Inheritance. Classes can reuse code and properties from other classes. 
- Polymorphism. Objects are designed to share behaviors, and they can take on more than one form.
